QuickHeal is a simple QoL mod that adds a keybind (default: H) that will consume the first edible item in your inventory that has a net positive Health/Energy gain.

This will bypass the prompt that asks you if you're sure you want to eat this, so that you can avoid needing to confirm.

This is especially useful in Multiplayer where the game does not pause while asking you if you want to eat it.
